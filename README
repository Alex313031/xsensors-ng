xsensors - Mystro256 fork
------------------------------

This is an updated fork of xsensors (http://www.linuxhardware.org/xsensors/),
which continues development where the original stream left off. It includes
GTK3 support, a preference menu, bugfixes and various updates.

This is a program designed to display all the related information from your
motherboard sensors.  This information is gathered via lm_sensors, the software
drivers that actually gathers the sensor information.

Requirements:
- lm_sensors 3.0.0+ (http://www.lm-sensors.org)
- gtk+ 2 or 3 (http://www.gtk.org)
- cairo (https://www.cairographics.org)

Installation:

./configure
make
make install

I would suggest running the detect script if you don't have lm_sensors
configured yet:

sudo sensors-detect
