xsensors 0.75 - Mystro256 fork
------------------------------

This is another release of xsensors, a program designed to display all
the related information from your motherboard sensors.  This information is
gathered via lm_sensors, the software drivers that actually gathers the 
sensor information.

Requirements:
- lm_sensors 3.0.0+ (http://www.lm-sensors.org)
- gtk+ 2.x.x+ (http://www.gtk.org)

Installation:

./configure
make
make install

I would suggest running the detect script if you don't have lm_sensors
configured yet:

sudo sensors-detect
