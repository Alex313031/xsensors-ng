0.40
-----
- xsensors is now a GTK2 app.  Sorry, GTK1 is no longer supported but I doubt few will care.
- Fahrenheit didn't work.  It would have been nice to actually write the code to begin with.  It works now.
- Added support for lm85, lm85b, lm85c, adm1027, adt7463, emc6d100.
- Added new option "-t time" in order to set refresh delay.
- New look overall.  Notebook background is now white.  Frames used to isolate individual items.  I think it looks cleaner.  This all should make things seem a bit more uniform.
- Added new option "-v" to show version number.
- Version number now displayed in the title bar.
