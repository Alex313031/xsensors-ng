For 0.80:
- Some bugs I need to look into:
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1108377
- Add argument to show stderr messages as message dialogs
- GUI option to re-autodetect sensors (should launch a terminal,
  "sensors-detect --auto is not considered safe)
- If default config file doesn't exist and "-c" is not used, give an option to
  autodetect sensors, see previous item
Low Priority:
- Better range readouts (neat speedometer type possibly)
- Port gtkbox in gtk3 to gtkgrid
