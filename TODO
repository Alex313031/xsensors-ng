For 0.80:
- Filter file chooser to only show gdkpixbuf supported types
- Check if theme file is correct size
Low Priority:
- Better range readouts (neat speedometer type possibly)
- Port gtkbox to gtkgrid (probably deprecated in the future)
- Appmenu for gtk3
Undecided:
- Preference to change sensors config file (default or select)
